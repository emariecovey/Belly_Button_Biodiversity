# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

A study was conducted in order to investigate and document bacterial species found in the belly button of test subjects who donated their bacteria. The human body has thousands of types of bacteria, and different types of bacteria are found in different parts of the body. Also, bacterial species vary from person to person, even in the same location. This dashboard contains visuals of the data collected in the study, and is a way for other bacterial researchers and research participants to easily find out more about bacterial species in navels.

The data was provided in a large json file. Data was parsed using javascript, and an html page displays the dashboard. The dashboard is comprised of a bubble, bar and gauge chart, created by plotly. The charts are dynamic, and different subject id numbers can be selected to display each subject's bacteria. D3 was used to help the code display different data based on user input. 

This rendering of this code in a webpage format can be viewed by going to github settings, selecting "pages" under code and automation, and clicking on the link.
